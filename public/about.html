    <h1>About Derek!</h1>
    <p>There's not much to say. I like animals, sports, video games, music. I also like to work out.
        I'm hoping that someday I can master this stuff well enough to maybe fool a company into
        hiring me. React is hard. I'm better at it now, at least.
    </p>
